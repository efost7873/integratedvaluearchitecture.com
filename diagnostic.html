      <h1>The IVA Diagnostic</h1>
    </div>

    <p>The IVA Diagnostic is the entry point into Integrated Value Architecture. It reveals how an organization is structured, how decisions move, and where performance pressures originate. The Diagnostic does not implement change. It establishes the structural baseline required for governance and performance decisions.</p>

    <p>For more than a century, financial accounting systems shaped internal performance even though they were created for external reporting. The Diagnostic helps you see how this history continues to shape daily work and organizational behavior.</p>

      <h2>What You Are Experiencing</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Most organizations experience the same structural patterns, even when the context is different. These patterns are not signs of poor management or weak culture. They are signals that the organization has outgrown the structure it inherited.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>decisions that take longer than they should</li>
      <li>work that moves inconsistently across teams</li>
      <li>capacity that collapses under pressure</li>
      <li>coordination that depends on specific people being available</li>
      <li>problems that return in new forms</li>
      <li>leaders absorbing work the system should carry</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Diagnostic helps you understand why these signals appear and what they reveal about your governance architecture.</p>
