    <h1>The IVA Diagnostic</h1>
    <p>
      The IVA Diagnostic is the entry point into Integrated Value Architecture. It provides a clear, evidence based understanding of how your organization is structured, how decisions move, and where performance pressures originate. It does not implement change. It establishes the structural baseline needed to make informed decisions about governance and performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      IVA is grounded in the history of management accounting and organizational behavior. For more than a century, financial accounting systems shaped internal performance even though they were created for external reporting. The Diagnostic helps you see how this history shapes your daily work and where structural conditions may be creating friction.

  <!-- WHAT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING -->
  <section style="margin-bottom: 48px;">
    <h1>What You Are Experiencing</h1>

    <p>
      Most organizations feel the same structural patterns even when the context is different. These patterns are not signs of poor management or weak culture. They are signals that the organization has outgrown the structure it inherited.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>decisions that take longer than they should</li>
      <li>work that moves inconsistently across teams</li>
      <li>capacity that collapses under pressure</li>
      <li>coordination that depends on specific people being available</li>
      <li>problems that return in new forms</li>
      <li>leaders absorbing work the system should carry</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The Diagnostic helps you understand why these signals appear and what they reveal about your governance architecture.

  <!-- WHAT THE DIAGNOSTIC REVEALS -->
  <section style="margin-bottom: 48px;">
    <h1>What the Diagnostic Reveals</h1>

    <p>
      The IVA Diagnostic maps the structure of your organization. It examines how decisions flow, how authority is distributed, how work moves, and how the organization is designed to function. It identifies early indicators of structural risk, governance failures, and decision rights misalignment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Diagnostic uses the five IVA ledgers as an analytical lens, not as an implementation framework. It does not align your organization with the ledgers. It identifies where the ledgers are already signaling dominance, neglect, or distortion.

        <h3>Financial Structure</h3>

    <p>
      The Diagnostic does not prescribe solutions. It reveals the structure that has been shaping outcomes, often for years, without being visible.

  <!-- WHY IT MATTERS -->
  <section style="margin-bottom: 48px;">
    <h1>Why the Diagnostic Matters</h1>

    <p>
      Most tools measure symptoms. The Diagnostic measures structure. It provides a factual, evidence based foundation for understanding how the organization functions and where structural conditions support or constrain performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      This clarity is the foundation for Step 2 of IVA, which is implementation. The Diagnostic does not implement change. It prepares the ground for it.

  <!-- WHAT YOU GAIN -->
  <section style="margin-bottom: 48px;">
    <h1>What You Gain</h1>

    <p>
      The Diagnostic produces a single output: the diagnostic report. This report provides a structural map of your organization and helps you understand:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>where decisions slow down and why</li>
      <li>how authority and responsibility are distributed</li>
      <li>where capacity is strained or unsupported</li>
      <li>how external forces shape internal behavior</li>
      <li>how learning and adaptation occur in practice</li>
      <li>where structural risks and governance failures may be emerging</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This map becomes the basis for informed decisions about governance, structure, and long term performance.
