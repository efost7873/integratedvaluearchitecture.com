  <h1>The IVA Diagnostic</h1>
  <p>
    Every organization feels the same pressure, even if the context looks different.  
    The friction, the load, the slow decisions, the heroic effort that keeps everything moving — none of it is personal and none of it is unique.  
    It is structural.
  </p>

  <p>
    The IVA Diagnostic is the first process that shows leaders the architecture underneath their experience.  
    It reveals why the work feels heavier than it should, why excellence depends on individual effort, and why the same problems return no matter how many tools, plans, or consultants you’ve tried.
  </p>

<section>
  <h1>What You’re Feeling — And Why</h1>

  <p>
    If you are here, it is because you have built something that works — often better than it should.  
    You’ve solved problems faster than the structure can adapt.  
    You’ve carried load the system should have absorbed.  
    You’ve kept the operation moving through judgment, experience, and sheer endurance.
  </p>

  <p>
    And yet, despite the success, you feel:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>decisions that should be simple taking longer than they should</li>
    <li>work bouncing between people because ownership is unclear</li>
    <li>teams stretched thin even when performance is high</li>
    <li>coordination that relies on the right people being in the right place</li>
    <li>problems that disappear and then return in a new form</li>
    <li>leaders carrying work the system should absorb</li>
    <li>success depending on individual effort rather than structure</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These are not management issues.  
    These are not culture issues.  
    These are not people issues.  
    These are structural signals — and they show up in every organization that has outgrown the architecture it inherited.

  <h1>What the Diagnostic Reveals</h1>

  <p>
    The IVA Diagnostic maps the five structural domains that determine how your organization actually behaves:
  </p>

  <div class="grid grid-2">

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Financial</h3>
      <p>The incentives, reporting structures, and constraints that shape decisions long before strategy enters the room.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Operational</h3>
      <p>The workflows, handoffs, and real-world behaviors that reveal how work actually moves — not how it is charted.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Capacity</h3>
      <p>The distribution of load across people, roles, and systems, including the invisible work leaders absorb without noticing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Externalities & Equity</h3>
      <p>The regulatory, legal, and environmental forces that silently shape structure, risk, and decision-making.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Learning & Innovation</h3>
      <p>The organization’s ability to adapt, integrate new tools, and evolve without destabilizing the system.</p>
    </div>

  </div>

  <p>
    These domains expose the architecture that has been shaping your performance for years — including the parts you’ve been compensating for without realizing it.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Why Nothing You’ve Tried Has Worked</h1>

  <p>
    Strategic plans collapse because decision rights are misaligned.  
    Scorecards stall because authority is concentrated in the wrong places.  
    Dashboards mislead because they only measure what is easy to track.  
    Workshops fade because the structure resets the moment the consultants leave.
  </p>

  <p>
    You have been treating symptoms.  
    The Diagnostic shows you the system that creates them.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>What Changes After the Diagnostic</h1>

  <p>
    When the structure becomes visible, everything gets lighter:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>decisions move cleanly</li>
    <li>coordination stabilizes across functions</li>
    <li>capacity stops collapsing under pressure</li>
    <li>leaders stop absorbing invisible work</li>
    <li>teams stop relying on heroics to keep things moving</li>
    <li>the system stops generating friction</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The Diagnostic gives you the first clear picture of how your organization actually works — and what becomes possible when the architecture finally matches the work.

  <h1>Begin the Diagnostic</h1>

  <p>
    If you read this page and felt recognized — if you saw your organization in these patterns — the Diagnostic is the next step.
  </p>

  <p>
    It begins with a brief intake form. I’ll review your submission and follow up with next steps.
