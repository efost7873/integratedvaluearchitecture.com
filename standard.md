# The IVA Standard

IVA reveals the structural patterns that organizations inherit from industrial‑era financial dominance. These patterns shape incentives, reporting, governance, and decision‑making long before strategy or culture ever enter the picture.

## What the Standard Covers

- Structural signals  
- Governance alignment  
- Operational coherence  
- Compliance load  
- Document architecture  
- Diagnostic sequencing  
- Implementation readiness  

## Why It Works

IVA succeeds where strategic plans, dashboards, and scorecards fail because it exposes the underlying structure — not the symptoms.

More detailed sections will be added as the full Standard is published.
