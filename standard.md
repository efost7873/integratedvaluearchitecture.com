  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section style="margin-bottom: 48px;">
    <h1>IVA Standard Version 1.0</h1>
    <p>
      The IVA Standard defines the architecture and rules of Integrated Value Architecture. It is a multi ledger accounting and performance system that measures organizational structure. The standard establishes a unified method for assessing structural integrity, decision pathways, capacity conditions, legitimacy, and long term organizational reliability.
    </p>
    <p>
      IVA is grounded in the history of management accounting, organizational behavior, and financialization research. For more than a century, financial accounting systems shaped internal performance regimes even though they were designed for external reporting. IVA corrects this structural imbalance by introducing a multi ledger architecture that reflects how modern organizations actually create value.

  <!-- FIVE LEDGERS OVERVIEW -->
  <section style="margin-bottom: 48px;">
    <h1>The Five Ledgers Introduced by the IVA Standard</h1>
    <p>
      The IVA Standard establishes five structural ledgers. Each ledger captures a different dimension of organizational value and each uses formal recognition rules, measurement rules, evidence requirements, and structural event categories.

        <h3>Financial Ledger</h3>
        <p>
          Measures financial assets, liabilities, and equity in dollars. This ledger remains essential but is no longer the sole definition of performance.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Operational Ledger</h3>
        <p>
          Measures workflow and execution structure using Structural Value Units. Captures throughput, quality, and process integrity.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Capacity Ledger</h3>
        <p>
          Measures staffing, skills, systems, data quality, and infrastructure using Structural Value Units. Defines the structural ability of the organization to support its work.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Externalities and Equity Ledger</h3>
        <p>
          Measures legitimacy and distributional structure using Structural Value Units. Captures community impact, fairness, stakeholder burden, and environmental effects.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Learning and Innovation Ledger</h3>
        <p>
          Measures learning and adaptation structure using Structural Value Units. Captures experimentation, knowledge creation, and organizational resilience.

  <!-- WHAT THE STANDARD DEFINES -->
  <section style="margin-bottom: 48px;">
    <h1>What the IVA Standard Defines</h1>
    <p>
      IVA Standard Version 1.0 documents the core architecture of the system. It defines the recognition rules, measurement rules, evidence standards, structural event taxonomy, and reporting cadence for all five ledgers. These rules ensure that structural conditions are measured consistently across organizations and sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The standard also establishes the valuation method for Structural Value Units. Each structural position is scored using criteria for strength, scope, persistence, evidence quality, and cross ledger impact. These scores create a structural valuation that can be audited and reconciled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Future versions of the standard will introduce licensing requirements, attribution rules, and governance structures for organizations that adopt IVA as their internal performance architecture.

  <!-- HISTORICAL BACKBONE -->
  <section style="margin-bottom: 48px;">
    <h1>Historical and Theoretical Foundation</h1>
    <p>
      IVA is built on more than a century of research and practice. Early cost accounting systems were created for industrial production and external reporting. Over time, these systems became internal performance regimes. This shift created predictable distortions. Financial indicators became the primary signals of success. Capacity, learning, legitimacy, and operational structure were pushed to the margins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research across management accounting, organizational behavior, and financialization studies shows that financial dominance weakens collaboration, reduces innovation, and limits long term performance. IVA responds to this history by creating a structural accounting system that distributes authority across functions and captures the full spectrum of organizational value.
