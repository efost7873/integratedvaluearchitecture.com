    <h1>IVA Standard Version 1.0</h1>
    <p>The IVA Standard defines the architecture and rules of Integrated Value Architecture. It is a multi ledger accounting and governance system that measures organizational structure. The standard establishes a unified method for understanding structural integrity, decision pathways, capacity conditions, legitimacy, and long term organizational reliability.</p>
    <p>IVA is grounded in the history of management accounting, organizational behavior, and financialization research. For more than a century, financial accounting systems shaped internal performance even though they were created for external reporting. IVA responds to this history by introducing a structural accounting system that reflects how modern organizations create value.</p>

    <p>The IVA Standard establishes five structural ledgers. Each ledger captures a different dimension of organizational value and uses formal definitions and evidence expectations.</p>
