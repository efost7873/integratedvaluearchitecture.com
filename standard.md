# The IVA Standard

IVA reveals the structural patterns that organizations inherit from industrial‑era financial dominance. These patterns shape incentives, reporting, governance, and decision‑making long before strategy or culture ever enter the picture.

## Overview {#overview}

The Standard provides a structural lens for understanding organizational behavior, misalignment, and execution failure.

## Structural Patterns {#patterns}

IVA identifies recurring patterns that appear across industries, sectors, and organizational sizes.

## Governance Alignment {#governance}

Governance determines how decisions are made, who holds authority, and how accountability is structured.

## Operational Coherence {#operations}

Operational systems often drift from governance intent, creating friction and inefficiency.

## Compliance Load {#compliance}

Compliance requirements shape behavior in ways leaders rarely see but always feel.

## Document Architecture {#documents}

Documents encode power, authority, and operational reality. IVA exposes the hidden structure inside them.

## Diagnostic Sequence {#diagnostic}

IVA’s diagnostic process reveals structural misalignment before it becomes visible in performance.
