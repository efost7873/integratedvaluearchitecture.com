# Welcome to Integrated Value Architecture

IVA helps leaders, students, and organizations understand the deep structural patterns inherited from industrial‑era financial dominance — patterns that still shape modern systems, incentives, and decision‑making.

This site will serve as the home for:

- The IVA Standard  
- Research and academic contributions  
- Diagnostic tools  
- Implementation guidance  
- Teaching and learning resources  

More content will be added as the framework continues to evolve.
