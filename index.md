    <h1>What Integrated Value Architecture Is</h1>
    <p>Integrated Value Architecture is a multi ledger governance system that identifies and measures the structural conditions that shape organizational behavior. It replaces the single ledger financial model that has dominated organizations since the industrial era. IVA distributes decision authority across functions and creates a coherent architecture for long term performance and legitimacy.</p>
    <p>IVA is grounded in research across management accounting, organizational behavior, and financialization studies. For more than a century, financial accounting systems shaped internal performance even though they were created for external reporting. IVA corrects this imbalance by introducing a structural accounting system that reflects how modern organizations create value.</p>

    <h1>What People Realize When They See IVA</h1>

    <div class="grid grid-2">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>You have been treating symptoms, not structure.</h3>
        <p>Plans and dashboards fail because the underlying structure resets the moment the consultants leave. IVA makes the structure visible and changeable.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Finance has been defining performance for everyone.</h3>
        <p>When a single ledger defines success, financial metrics dominate every conversation. IVA corrects this imbalance by giving other domains formal standing.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Your capacity problems were never just people problems.</h3>
        <p>Vacancies, burnout, system failures, and data unreliability are structural liabilities. IVA treats them as structural positions, not individual shortcomings.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Decisions get stuck because decision rights are misaligned.</h3>
        <p>Authority is concentrated in the wrong places, and cross functional work has no structural support. IVA maps decision pathways and reveals where misalignment occurs.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Your organization runs on structural waste.</h3>
        <p>Rework, workaround, duplication, and crisis driven tasks consume capacity. IVA identifies the structural sources of this waste so it can be removed instead of managed.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>You have never had a way to measure legitimacy.</h3>
        <p>The Externalities and Equity Ledger captures community impact, fairness, stakeholder burden, and distributional effects.</p>
      </div>

    <h1>The Five Ledgers of IVA</h1>
    <p>Traditional accounting systems were built for linear production and tangible assets. IVA introduces a multi ledger architecture that reflects how modern organizations create value.</p>

    <div class="grid grid-3">

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Financial Ledger</h3>
        <p>Measures financial assets, liabilities, and equity in dollars. Essential but not sufficient to describe organizational health.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Operational Ledger</h3>
        <p>Measures workflow and execution structure using Structural Value Units. Captures throughput, quality, and process integrity.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Capacity Ledger</h3>
        <p>Measures staffing, skills, systems, data quality, and infrastructure using Structural Value Units.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Externalities and Equity Ledger</h3>
        <p>Measures legitimacy and distributional structure using Structural Value Units.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Learning and Innovation Ledger</h3>
        <p>Measures learning and adaptation structure using Structural Value Units.</p>

    <h1>How IVA Works</h1>

    <div class="grid grid-3">

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Step 1. Diagnostic</h3>
        <p>IVA maps the existing structure. It identifies how decisions move, how authority is distributed, and where structural risks may be emerging.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Step 2. Implementation</h3>
        <p>The five ledgers are defined for your organization. Governance, reporting pathways, and structural roles are designed as a single system.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Step 3. Evaluation and Ongoing Support</h3>
        <p>IVA provides continued support to maintain structural integrity and ensure the architecture holds under pressure.</p>
