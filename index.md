  <!-- WHAT IVA IS -->
  <section style="margin-bottom: 48px;">
    <h1>What Integrated Value Architecture Is</h1>
    <p>
      Integrated Value Architecture (IVA) is a multi ledger governance system that identifies and measures the structural conditions that shape organizational behavior. It replaces the single ledger financial model that has dominated organizations since the industrial era and early cost accounting. IVA distributes decision authority across functions and creates a coherent architecture for long term performance and legitimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      IVA is grounded in research across management accounting, organizational behavior, and financialization studies. It responds to a century of financial dominance, where external reporting tools became internal performance regimes and distorted how organizations define success.

  <!-- OMG MOMENTS -->
  <section style="margin-bottom: 48px;">
    <h1>What People Realize When They See IVA</h1>

    <div class="grid grid-2">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>You have been treating symptoms, not structure.</h3>
        <p>
          Strategic plans, dashboards, and retreats fail because the underlying structure resets the moment the consultants leave. IVA makes the structure visible and changeable.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Finance has been defining performance for everyone.</h3>
        <p>
          Not by intent, but by architecture. When a single ledger defines success, financial metrics dominate every conversation. IVA corrects this imbalance by giving other domains formal standing.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Your capacity problems were never just people problems.</h3>
        <p>
          Vacancies, burnout, skill gaps, system failures, and data unreliability are structural liabilities. IVA treats them as ledger positions, not as individual shortcomings.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Decisions get stuck because decision rights are misaligned.</h3>
        <p>
          Authority is concentrated in the wrong places, and cross functional work has no structural support. IVA maps decision pathways and realigns them with the work.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Your organization runs on structural waste.</h3>
        <p>
          Rework, workaround, duplication, and crisis driven tasks consume capacity. IVA identifies the structural sources of this waste so it can be removed instead of managed.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>You have never had a way to measure legitimacy.</h3>
        <p>
          The Externalities and Equity Ledger captures community impact, fairness, stakeholder burden, and distributional effects. It brings legitimacy into the same structural frame as finance.

  <!-- FIVE LEDGERS -->
  <section style="margin-bottom: 48px;">
    <h1>The Five Ledgers of IVA</h1>
    <p>
      Traditional accounting systems were built for linear production and tangible assets. IVA introduces a multi ledger architecture that reflects how modern organizations actually create value.
    </p>

    <div class="grid grid-3">

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Financial Ledger</h3>
        <p>
          Traditional financial performance. Revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, and cash flow. Essential, but not sufficient to describe organizational health.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Operational Ledger</h3>
        <p>
          Process efficiency and quality. Throughput, cycle time, error rates, and service performance. The structural record of how work actually moves.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Capacity Ledger</h3>
        <p>
          Workforce readiness, system reliability, data quality, and infrastructure strength. The structural ability of the organization to support its work.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Externalities and Equity Ledger</h3>
        <p>
          Community impact, environmental effects, fairness, and stakeholder burden. The structural record of legitimacy and distributional impact.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Learning and Innovation Ledger</h3>
        <p>
          Experimentation, adaptation, and knowledge creation. Pilots, prototypes, lessons learned, and process improvements that build resilience over time.

    <h1>What IVA Provides</h1>

    <div class="grid grid-3">

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Structural Diagnostics</h3>
        <p>
          IVA exposes the hidden patterns that shape incentives, reporting, authority, and workload. It reveals structural distortions that no dashboard or scorecard can show.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>The IVA Standard</h3>
        <p>
          A governance first, multi ledger architecture with formal valuation rules, evidence requirements, and audit procedures. A structural accounting standard for modern organizations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Implementation System</h3>
        <p>
          A coherent five ledger structure that aligns governance, operations, capacity, equity, and learning. It replaces ad hoc tools with a durable, institutional architecture.

  <!-- HOW IVA WORKS -->
  <section style="margin-bottom: 48px;">
    <h1>How IVA Works in Practice</h1>

    <div class="grid grid-3">

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Step 1. Structural Diagnostic</h3>
        <p>
          IVA maps the existing structure. It identifies distortions created by financial dominance, fragmented data, misaligned authority, and unmanaged externalities.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Step 2. Architectural Design</h3>
        <p>
          The five ledgers are defined for your organization. Metrics, evidence requirements, decision rights, and reporting pathways are designed as a single governance system.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Step 3. Implementation and Realignment</h3>
        <p>
          Structural waste is removed. Authority, incentives, and capacity are realigned with strategy. The organization gains a performance architecture that can hold under pressure.
        </p>

  <!-- WHO IVA SERVES -->
  <section style="margin-bottom: 48px;">
    <h1>Who IVA Serves</h1>
    <p>
      IVA is built for people who work in or with organizations across all sectors. It is relevant wherever structure, performance, and legitimacy matter.
    </p>

    <div class="grid grid-3">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Executives and Senior Leaders</h3>
        <p>
          Gain a structural view of performance that explains why plans fail, where authority is misaligned, and how to repair the system.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Managers and Cross Functional Teams</h3>
        <p>
          See how structural conditions create overload, rework, and conflict. Use the ledgers to argue for changes that the current system cannot see.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Public, Nonprofit, and Community Organizations</h3>
        <p>
          Measure legitimacy, equity, and external impact with the same structural rigor that finance applies to money.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Boards and Oversight Bodies</h3>
        <p>
          Move beyond narrow financial indicators. Use IVA to understand long term health, risk, and structural integrity.

      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Students and Researchers</h3>
        <p>
          Work with a historically grounded, theoretically coherent framework that connects financial dominance, governance, and organizational behavior.
