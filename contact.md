    <h1>What to Expect</h1>

    <p>
      IVA receives inquiries from executives, managers, public sector teams, nonprofit leaders, researchers, and students. I review every message personally. You can expect:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>a timely response based on the nature of your inquiry</li>
      <li>follow up questions if more context is needed</li>
      <li>clear next steps if your inquiry relates to the IVA Diagnostic</li>
      <li>guidance on whether IVA is the right fit for your organization or research</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      IVA does not use automated routing or multiple inboxes. Everything comes directly to me so the structure of your inquiry is understood from the start.
