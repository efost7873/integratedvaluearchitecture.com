      <h1>The Operational Ledger</h1>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        For COOs and operations leaders responsible for throughput, SLA adherence, delivery predictability, and cross-functional execution.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      The IVA Operational Ledger records how work actually moves across the organization. It captures queue behavior, handoff latency, escalation patterns, and reliability conditions that usually live inside dashboards but are not governed structurally.
    </p>

    <p>
      When delivery depends on heroics, escalation velocity, and informal coordination, the system is already unstable. The Operational Ledger makes these conditions durable and governable without blaming teams for structural design flaws.
    </p>

    <p>
      This ledger exists so operations does not have to prove structural reality through outages, missed SLAs, churn, or executive escalation.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Reduced SLA erosion under load</h3>
        <p>
          SLA degradation driven by queue instability and hidden dependencies becomes visible earlier, reducing reactive escalation and reputation risk.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Backlog growth becomes diagnosable</h3>
        <p>
          Persistent backlog accumulation is treated as a structural condition instead of a motivation problem. Throughput constraints are recorded directly.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Improved delivery predictability</h3>
        <p>
          Cycle time instability and deadline compression are traced to structural dependencies, reducing last-minute reprioritization.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Lower escalation velocity</h3>
        <p>
          Escalations are recorded as evidence of structural strain, reducing the cycle where urgent work continuously displaces strategic work.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Less cross-functional latency</h3>
        <p>
          Approval drag, review loops, and interdepartmental dependency churn are captured as structural conditions instead of recurring frustration.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Reduced tool-switching overhead</h3>
        <p>
          Fragmented systems and workflow fragmentation become visible as operational debt instead of invisible time loss.

        These are the patterns that usually show up in executive reviews but are rarely governed as structure.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Throughput constraints become governable</h3>
        <p>
          Queue instability, dependency bottlenecks, and sequencing breakdowns are recorded as structural realities, allowing deliberate intervention instead of repeated escalation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Execution stops depending on heroics</h3>
        <p>
          Key-person dependency and informal knowledge pathways are identified before they create fragility or turnover risk.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Service quality stabilizes under pressure</h3>
        <p>
          Quality drift under load is recognized as structural strain rather than inconsistent team performance.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Post-mortems produce durable change</h3>
        <p>
          Exception handling and incident reviews generate structural records instead of disappearing once the crisis resolves.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Operational authority becomes clearer</h3>
        <p>
          COOs gain clearer boundaries over execution design, workflow structure, and reliability conditions instead of absorbing accountability without authority.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Cross-functional friction decreases</h3>
        <p>
          Dependency drag between finance, compliance, product, and delivery becomes measurable and governable instead of political.

        <p>

      <div class="card">
