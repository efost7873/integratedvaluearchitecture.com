      <h1>The Capacity Ledger</h1>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        For leaders responsible for staffing reality, readiness, sustainability, and the limits that plans keep ignoring.

    <p>
      The IVA Capacity Ledger records the organization’s actual ability to carry work. It captures load distribution, role coverage, hiring lag, ramp time, system constraints, data quality limits, and infrastructure fragility as durable structural conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      In most organizations, capacity is treated as a management issue or a motivation issue. In practice, it is structural. When plans repeatedly exceed what the organization can support, the system produces predictable outcomes. Backlogs grow. SLAs erode. Quality drifts. People burn out. Turnover rises. Leaders absorb work the structure should carry.
    </p>

    <p>
      This ledger exists so capacity stops being informal. Capacity becomes recordable, measurable, and governable before the organization pays for it through churn and failure.

      <h2>What changes in daily capacity management</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="grid grid-3">

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Fewer overcommitment cycles</h3>
        <p>
          Commitments can be evaluated against documented readiness instead of optimism, urgency, or executive pressure.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Hiring and ramp time become real inputs</h3>
        <p>
          Capacity planning reflects recruiting lag, onboarding time, and skill acquisition instead of treating headcount as an instant switch.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Load stops hiding in “invisible work”</h3>
        <p>
          Coordination, exception handling, rework, compliance lift, and tool switching overhead stop being treated as free.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Coverage gaps stop being surprises</h3>
        <p>
          Single points of failure, fragile on-call rotations, and role coverage gaps are recorded as structural risks, not discovered during outages.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Burnout becomes preventable</h3>
        <p>
          Chronic overload is recognized early as a structural condition, reducing the cycle of attrition followed by emergency hiring.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>System constraints stop looking like people problems</h3>
        <p>
          Data quality, tooling limits, and infrastructure fragility are recorded directly, reducing blame and repeated “try harder” management.

      <h2>Capacity benefits that matter in practice</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        These are the failure patterns that appear as performance issues but are usually capacity structure.

    </div>

    <div class="grid grid-2">

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Attrition becomes a structural signal</h3>
        <p>
          Turnover is often treated as a people issue. IVA helps show where churn is structurally generated through overload, coverage gaps, and unrecoverable workload.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Plans stop assuming unlimited bandwidth</h3>
        <p>
          Capacity becomes an explicit governance input, reducing strategic plans that are operationally impossible from day one.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Readiness becomes defensible</h3>
        <p>
          Leaders can justify “not yet” with durable evidence instead of negotiation, personal credibility, or repeated escalations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Operational stability improves</h3>
        <p>
          Many operational failures originate in sustained overload. When capacity limits are governed, reliability and throughput stabilize.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Training and skill depth stop being optional</h3>
        <p>
          Skill coverage and knowledge depth become structural assets instead of informal expectations, reducing key-person dependency.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Infrastructure debt becomes visible</h3>
        <p>
          Tooling, data, and system constraints that quietly consume capacity become durable records, strengthening investment decisions.

    <div class="grid grid-2">

      <div class="card">
        <h3>No motivational framing</h3>
        <p>
          IVA does not treat overload as an attitude problem. It records structural limits and makes them governable.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>No headcount-as-capacity simplification</h3>
        <p>
          Capacity is not a staffing number. IVA accounts for ramp time, skill depth, coverage, systems, and workflow overhead.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>No “just hire more people” default</h3>
        <p>
          IVA does not assume hiring solves structure. It distinguishes between capacity problems that require staffing and those caused by workflow and system design.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>No culture substitution</h3>
        <p>
          IVA does not replace governance with culture initiatives. It makes limits explicit so the organization stops committing to work it cannot support.
