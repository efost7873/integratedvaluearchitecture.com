      <h3>Beyond Financial Dominance</h3>

      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Evan Micheal Foster</p>
      <p><strong>Platform:</strong> SSRN</p>
      <p><strong>Abstract ID:</strong> 6050034</p>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> Springfield, Illinois</p>

      <p>This paper identifies a structural condition common across sectors: financial accounting systems created for external reporting gradually became the dominant internal governance logic. The result is not simply budget pressure. It is architectural distortion. The paper clarifies how this shift occurred and outlines the governance consequences that follow when one ledger becomes the primary definition of value.</p>

      <p><strong>Availability:</strong> Hosted on SSRN. The abstract is publicly available. Full-text download availability depends on SSRN access and posting status.</p>

        <h3>Always Over Capacity</h3>
        <p><strong>Format:</strong> Book manuscript</p>
        <p><strong>Status:</strong> In development (Expected 2026)</p>

        <p>This manuscript examines why work keeps rolling downhill inside organizations. It traces structural overload to governance architecture rather than culture, motivation, or leadership personality. The book builds a shared language for recognizing structural distortion without assigning blame to any single role.</p>

        <p><strong>Status:</strong> Ongoing</p>

        <p>This research analyzes how federal tax policy reinforces financialization across sectors and how those incentives propagate into reporting standards, governance structure, and resource distribution.</p>
