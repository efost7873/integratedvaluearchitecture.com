    <p>Integrated Value Architecture is grounded in original work on governance structure, financial dominance, plural value recognition, and multi-ledger accounting design. This page collects published research and active manuscripts connected to that work.</p>

        <h3>Beyond Financial Dominance</h3>
        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Evan M. Foster</p>
        <p><strong>Platform:</strong> SSRN</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract ID:</strong> 6050034</p>
        <p>This paper names a structural pattern that most organizations recognize but rarely address directly. It clarifies how financial accounting gained practical control over internal priorities, then traces the governance consequences that follow when one ledger becomes the whole story.</p>
        <p><strong>Availability:</strong> Hosted on SSRN. The SSRN page shows the abstract and may also provide a full-text download when available.</p>

        <h3>Always Over Capacity</h3>
        <p><strong>Format:</strong> Book manuscript</p>
        <p><strong>Status:</strong> In development</p>
        <p>This manuscript is written for leaders, operators, and boards who live inside structural overload. It shows how work keeps rolling downhill when governance architecture forces decisions into gaps that nobody owns, then builds a shared language for recognizing the pattern without turning any role into the villain.</p>

        <h3>Federal Tax Policy and Financialization</h3>
        <p><strong>Format:</strong> Doctoral research</p>
        <p><strong>Status:</strong> Ongoing</p>
        <p>This research examines how federal tax policy reinforces financialization across sectors and how those incentives propagate into governance structure, reporting behavior, and resource distribution.</p>

      <h2>Research Agenda</h2>
    </div>

    <p>IVA is being developed as a long-term governance discipline. Current research tracks include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Multi-ledger governance architecture theory and institutional design</li>
      <li>Structural event accounting systems and audit-ready evidence chains</li>
      <li>Ledger equity independence across domains of authority</li>
      <li>Internal monopoly formation inside organizations and how it distorts decision pathways</li>
      <li>Governance architecture as a prerequisite for AI-ready organizational data</li>
    </ul>
