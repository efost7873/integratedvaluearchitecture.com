      <h3>Beyond Financial Dominance</h3>

      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Evan Micheal Foster</p>
      <p><strong>Platform:</strong> SSRN</p>
      <p><strong>Abstract ID:</strong> 6050034</p>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> Springfield, Illinois</p>

      <p>This paper identifies a structural condition common across sectors. Financial accounting systems originally created for external reporting gradually became the dominant internal governance logic. The result is architectural distortion rather than simple budget pressure. The paper clarifies how this shift occurred and outlines the governance consequences that follow when one ledger becomes the primary definition of value.</p>

      <p><strong>Availability:</strong> The abstract is publicly available on SSRN. Full-text availability depends on SSRN posting status.</p>

      <h3>What Happens When Small Business Growth Outpaces Capacity</h3>

      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Evan Micheal Foster</p>
      <p><strong>Platform:</strong> Medium</p>
      <p><strong>Format:</strong> Public essay</p>

      <p>This essay examines a common small business failure pattern. Financials can remain strong while capacity quietly erodes. When only money is measured consistently, human limits stay informal and tradeoffs remain implicit. Over time, financially rational decisions accumulate into operational fragility.</p>

      <p><strong>Availability:</strong> Publicly available on Medium.</p>

        <h3>Always Over Capacity</h3>
        <p><strong>Format:</strong> Book manuscript</p>
        <p><strong>Status:</strong> In development (Expected 2026)</p>

        <p>This manuscript examines why work keeps rolling downhill inside organizations. It traces structural overload to governance architecture rather than culture or personality. The book builds a shared language for recognizing structural distortion without assigning blame to any single role.</p>

        <h3>Federal Tax Policy and Financialization</h3>
        <p><strong>Format:</strong> Doctoral research</p>
        <p><strong>Institution:</strong> University of Illinois Springfield</p>
        <p><strong>Status:</strong> Ongoing</p>

        <p>This research analyzes how federal tax policy reinforces financialization across sectors and how those incentives propagate into governance structure, reporting standards, and resource distribution.</p>
