        <h2>Building Governance Systems That Hold Under Pressure</h2>

        <p>Evan M. Foster is based in Springfield, Illinois and serves as Founder and Principal Architect of Integrated Value Architecture LLC.</p>

        <p>I build systems that repair what organizations cannot see. My work sits at the point where governance, structure, and performance meet. I created Integrated Value Architecture to address the structural problems that return no matter how many plans or tools leaders attempt. I built IVA because the structure has never been repaired.</p>

        <p>I study how decisions move, how authority flows, and how work is shaped by the system around it. My background spans public health, scientific operations, government programs, and organizational performance. Across all of them, I saw the same pattern. People were not failing. The structure was.</p>

  <!-- WHY I BUILT IVA -->
  <section id="about-why" class="iva-band-strong">
    <div class="section-header">
      <h2>Why I Built IVA</h2>
    </div>

    <p>IVA is grounded in the history of management accounting, organizational behavior, and financialization research. For more than a century, financial accounting systems shaped internal performance even though they were created for external reporting. This produced predictable distortions. IVA responds to this history by introducing a structural accounting system that reflects how modern organizations create value.</p>

    <p>IVA gives leaders a clear view of the conditions that support performance. It shows where the system creates friction, waste, and burnout. It provides a structural foundation for decisions that hold under pressure.</p>

        <h3>Financial Stewardship</h3>
        <p>Financial integrity stays intact, while other domains gain durable standing instead of routing every unresolved issue through finance.</p>

  <!-- BACKGROUND -->

      <h2>My Background</h2>
    </div>

    <p>I hold three degrees and a graduate certificate from the University of Illinois at Springfield. My work spans environmental health, statewide public health programs, scientific operations, and organizational governance. In each environment, I saw the same structural patterns that IVA now makes visible.</p>

    <p>I founded Integrated Value Architecture in 2026 to formalize the system I developed and to establish IVA as a modern accounting standard. My work focuses on structural integrity, organizational reliability, and long-term performance. I help leaders see the structure that has been shaping their outcomes for years.</p>
