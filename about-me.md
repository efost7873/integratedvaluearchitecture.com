      <h2>The Architect Who Fixes the Structure</h2>

      <p>
        I build systems that repair what organizations cannot see. My work sits at the point where governance, structure, and performance meet. I created Integrated Value Architecture to solve the problems that return no matter how many plans, dashboards, or initiatives leaders attempt. I built IVA because the structure has never been repaired.
      </p>

      <p>
        I study how decisions move, how authority flows, and how work is shaped by the system around it. My background spans public health, scientific operations, government programs, and organizational performance. Across all of them, I saw the same pattern. People were not failing. The structure was.

  <section>
    <p>
      IVA is a structural accounting system. It replaces the single financial lens with a multi ledger architecture that reflects how value is created. It gives leaders a clear view of the conditions that support performance. It shows where the system creates friction, waste, and burnout. It gives organizations a method for strengthening structure so strategy holds under pressure.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hold three degrees and a graduate certificate from the University of Illinois at Springfield. My work spans environmental health, statewide public health programs, scientific operations, and organizational governance. I founded Integrated Value Architecture in 2026 to formalize the system I developed and to establish IVA as a modern accounting standard.
    </p>

    <p>
      My work focuses on structural integrity, organizational reliability, and long term performance. I build systems that strengthen decisions, clarify authority, and reduce unnecessary work. I help leaders see the structure that has been shaping their outcomes for years.
