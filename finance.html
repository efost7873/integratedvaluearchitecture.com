      <h1>Finance Ledger Owner</h1>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        A page for CFOs, controllers, finance directors, budget officers, and anyone who carries fiduciary responsibility inside a single-ledger world.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      In most organizations, finance is the only domain with a true ledger. It has standards, audit logic, and authority that holds up under scrutiny. That structure creates discipline and comparability. It also forces finance to carry structural burdens that do not belong to finance, simply because finance is the only function with an authoritative record system.
    </p>

    <p>
      IVA keeps financial infrastructure intact. It adds formal ledger structure for other forms of value so finance is no longer asked to serve as the default referee, translator, and shock absorber for everything the organization cannot govern cleanly.

    <div class="section-header">
      <h2>What IVA does not do</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        IVA is not a replacement for financial accounting. It is governance architecture stabilization.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid grid-3">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>It does not replace standards</h3>
        <p>
          IVA does not replace GAAP or GASB. It does not change statutory reporting requirements or the fundamentals of financial controls.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>It does not dilute fiduciary authority</h3>
        <p>
          IVA does not weaken finance decision rights. It clarifies where finance authority is essential and where finance is being forced to govern other domains by default.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>It does not create parallel finance</h3>
        <p>
          IVA does not introduce a second financial accounting system. The Financial Ledger remains the monetary ledger under established financial standards.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

  <section id="finance-what-iva-recognizes">
    <div class="section-header">
      <h2>What IVA recognizes that most organizations cannot hold</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        Financial value is essential. It is not the only form of value that must be stewarded over time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Operational reliability, capacity limits, learning investments, and external obligations all shape long-term performance and legitimacy. In a single-ledger model, these domains exist as fragmented artifacts, informal negotiations, and inconsistent reporting. Finance often ends up carrying the consequences, not because finance is at fault, but because finance is the only domain with a disciplined evidence system.
    </p>

    <p>
      IVA distributes structural legitimacy across five ledgers. That single change reduces the hidden governance load that usually lands on finance.

  <section id="finance-what-changes" class="iva-band-soft">
    <div class="section-header">
      <h2>What changes structurally</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        Finance stays finance. Other domains stop being governed through budget pressure alone.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid grid-3">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Other domains gain ledger authority</h3>
        <p>
          Operational, Capacity, Learning and Innovation, and Externalities and Equity become formal governance domains with durable records.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Decision rights stop drifting</h3>
        <p>
          Authority boundaries become explicit across domains, which reduces cross-functional conflict that finance is usually expected to mediate.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Evidence becomes audit-ready beyond finance</h3>
        <p>
          Non-financial domains gain evidence rules that can be verified over time, which reduces the pressure to translate everything into money just to make it “real.”
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Cross-domain impacts are documented cleanly</h3>
        <p>
          Impacts can be linked across ledgers with evidence chains without collapsing every tradeoff into a budget workaround.

      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Structural liabilities stop hiding</h3>
        <p>
          Capacity constraints, operational fragility, legitimacy exposures, and deferred learning are surfaced as governable conditions, not surprises.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Finance stops being the default dumping ground</h3>
        <p>
          When other domains have formal standing, their burdens no longer automatically spill into finance through reporting requests, emergency funding, or late-cycle corrections.

        <h3>Fewer late-cycle reversals</h3>
        <p>
          Less rework from commitments made without operational reality or capacity limits being structurally visible.

      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>More stable forecasting</h3>
        <p>
          Forecast quality improves when non-financial constraints are recorded consistently instead of surfacing as last-minute exceptions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Cleaner budget accountability</h3>
        <p>
          Budget decisions become easier to explain when other domains carry their own evidence, limits, and authority pathways.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Reduced cross-domain arbitration</h3>
        <p>
          Finance is less frequently pulled into disputes that are operational, capacity-based, or compliance-driven by nature.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Lower compliance spillover</h3>
        <p>
          External obligations stop living as scattered reporting tasks that usually find their way to finance by default.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Restored governance partnership</h3>
        <p>
          Finance is re-centered as a disciplined governance partner instead of being treated as the place every unresolved domain issue must pass through.

      IVA is designed to separate structural issues from operational noise. It gives finance a way to protect financial integrity while reducing the structural overreach that finance is forced to carry in a single-ledger system.
