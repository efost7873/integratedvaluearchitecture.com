      <h1>The Financial Ledger</h1>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        For finance leaders responsible for audit readiness, close discipline, liquidity stability, forecasting credibility, and fiduciary accountability.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      The IVA Financial Ledger preserves the financial system you already operate. GAAP or GASB compliance remains intact. Your chart of accounts remains intact. Your ERP remains intact. Your close process remains intact. Your internal control environment remains intact. Your audit environment remains intact.
    </p>

    <p>
      IVA does not replace financial accounting. It prevents finance from being forced to absorb operational strain, capacity limits, external exposure, and deferred investment through the budget alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a single-ledger organization, finance becomes the clearinghouse for unresolved tension. Budget-to-actual volatility becomes the visible symptom of invisible structure. Variance absorbs execution flaws. Cash timing absorbs capacity strain. Compliance absorbs legitimacy risk. Capital planning absorbs deferred maintenance. IVA separates these pressures so finance can steward monetary value without being the default referee for everything else.

    </div>

    <div class="grid grid-3">

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Fewer emergency reallocations</h3>
        <p>
          Capacity strain and operational bottlenecks show up as documented conditions earlier, reducing mid-cycle transfers, last-minute reforecasts, and reactive reprioritization.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Cleaner forecasting inputs</h3>
        <p>
          Forecast assumptions become structurally grounded. Finance is less dependent on informal narratives, escalations, and “we just need it” requests to build projections.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Reduced budget-to-actual volatility</h3>
        <p>
          Recurring variance driven by workflow instability, deferred maintenance, staffing overload, and system fragility becomes visible as structure instead of surfacing as “unexpected spend.”
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>More stable cash timing</h3>
        <p>
          When operational conditions and capacity constraints are recorded directly, cash flow pressure is less likely to become the first place leadership discovers the organization is overcommitted.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Stronger board and oversight reporting</h3>
        <p>
          Financial results can be presented alongside documented operational, capacity, and external exposure conditions, protecting credibility when leaders ask why numbers moved.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Less finance-as-mediator work</h3>
        <p>
          Cross-functional conflict stops routing through finance by default. Tradeoffs become explicit through domain evidence instead of turning into budget fights.
        </p>

  <!-- FINANCE-SPECIFIC BENEFITS -->
  <section id="finance-benefits" class="iva-band-strong">
    <div class="section-header">
      <h2>Finance benefits that matter in practice</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        These are the places finance usually gets blamed for structural conditions it did not create.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid grid-2">

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Audit readiness stops being a scramble</h3>
        <p>
          When non-financial domains maintain durable, verifiable records, finance spends less time reconstructing rationale, chasing documentation, and translating operational reality into audit-friendly explanations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Internal control risk is easier to contain</h3>
        <p>
          Control risk often grows when workarounds become normal. IVA makes those workarounds visible as structural signals, which reduces the slow drift into control exceptions and rework.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Working capital and liquidity pressure become less reactive</h3>
        <p>
          Liquidity stress is often downstream of invisible throughput constraints and chronic deferral. IVA helps surface these drivers earlier, reducing sudden “cash surprises” that are really structural surprises.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Restricted funding tension becomes clearer</h3>
        <p>
          When capacity limits and operational constraints are recorded directly, finance can separate “we cannot legally spend it” from “we cannot operationally deliver it,” instead of forcing both into the same budget conversation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Capital planning becomes less political</h3>
        <p>
          Deferred maintenance and system fragility stop being treated as optional when the evidence is durable. Multi-year planning becomes more defensible and less dependent on who is loudest in the moment.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Fiduciary credibility strengthens</h3>
        <p>
          Finance is no longer positioned as the barrier to non-financial priorities. Tradeoffs become documented and structurally grounded, which supports credibility with boards, oversight bodies, and stakeholders.

        <h3>No replacement of accounting standards</h3>
        <p>
          IVA does not alter financial reporting standards, audit requirements, internal controls, procurement requirements, or compliance obligations.

      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>No parallel shadow general ledger</h3>
        <p>
          IVA is governance architecture. It does not create a competing financial accounting system or duplicate your financial systems.

      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>No dilution of financial authority</h3>
        <p>
          Financial decision rights remain intact. Other domains gain defined authority within their own value boundaries, which reduces pressure to resolve everything through the budget.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>No KPI dashboard substitution</h3>
        <p>
          IVA is not a reporting layer. It defines structural ownership, evidence expectations, and durable records across domains.
