      <h1>What Integrated Value Architecture Is</h1>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        Integrated Value Architecture LLC is a governance architecture firm based in Springfield, Illinois, founded by Evan Micheal Foster, Founder and Principal Architect.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Integrated Value Architecture is a multi-ledger governance system that identifies and measures the structural conditions that shape organizational behavior. It replaces the single-ledger financial model that has defined performance since the industrial era. IVA distributes decision authority across functions and creates a coherent architecture for long-term performance and legitimacy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Financial accounting systems were created for external reporting, yet they have shaped internal performance for more than a century. IVA corrects this structural imbalance by introducing a multi-ledger accounting system that reflects how modern organizations create, maintain, and distribute value.

      <h2>The structural mismatch IVA resolves</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        Organizations are asked to deliver more than financial results, yet they operate on a single-ledger model created for a different era.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Multiple demands, single ledger</h3>
        <p>
          Organizations are expected to deliver financial performance, operational reliability, workforce stability, community legitimacy, and future capability. A single financial ledger cannot represent these structural demands.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Financial dominance</h3>
        <p>
          When the financial ledger becomes the only ledger, it defines performance for every function. This creates structural distortions that no amount of effort or leadership can overcome.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Structural invisibility</h3>
        <p>
          Capacity limits, operational constraints, legitimacy exposures, and future capability investments remain invisible inside a single-ledger model. IVA makes these structural conditions measurable.
